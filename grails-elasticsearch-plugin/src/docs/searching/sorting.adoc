=== Sorting

To sort the search results, either a field name or a SortBuilder must be passed.

*Returned sort values*

The sort values are not part of the search results themselves but are part of `result.sort`.

`sort` contains all search values calculated by the ElasticSearch server as a list mapped to the id of the respective domain objects

*Example*

[source, groovy]
----
assert [1:[23, 42], 2: [24, 40]] == result.sort
