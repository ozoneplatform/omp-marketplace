== Introduction

The ElasticSearch plugin intends to implement a simple integration with Grails of the Open Source Search Engine http://www.elasticsearch.org/[ElasticSearch],
which is based on Lucene and provide distributed capabilities.

The plugin focus on exposing Grails domain classes for the moment. It highly takes the existing http://grails.org/plugin/searchable[Searchable Plugin] as
reference for its syntax and behaviour.

Note that the plugin is still under development, so you may not be able to use all the features of ElasticSearch yet.

In addition to this document, you may want to read the official ElasticSearch documentation http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/[here].
